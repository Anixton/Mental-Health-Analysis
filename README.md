<h1>Analyzing Students' Mental Health</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project delves into the impact of studying in a foreign country on the mental health of students. In 2018, a Japanese international university conducted a comprehensive survey on its students, resulting in a study approved by various ethical and regulatory boards.</p>
<p>The study's findings revealed that international students face an elevated risk of mental health challenges compared to the general population. Notably, factors such as social connectedness (sense of belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with adapting to a new culture) emerged as predictors of depression.</p>

<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to leverage SQL and Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment to analyze the university's student data. By doing so, we aim to validate or challenge the earlier findings and explore whether the duration of stay in the foreign country contributes significantly to mental health outcomes for international students.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data Source: Utilizing the dataset from the university's 2018 survey.</li>
  <li>Tools: Employing SQL for initial data exploration and Python in Jupyter Notebook for in-depth analysis.</li>
  <li>Focus Areas: Investigating social connectedness, acculturative stress, and the length of stay as potential factors influencing mental health outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
<p>Through this analysis, we seek to derive insights that contribute to the ongoing conversation on the mental health of international students. By examining specific factors and their correlations, we aim to enhance our understanding and provide valuable information for universities and policymakers.</p>
